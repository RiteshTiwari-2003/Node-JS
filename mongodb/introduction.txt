#### how to install mongodb 
go to this link on browser  https://mongodb.com/try/download/community 
now when you go to that url page then select that for which like linux window tou want to download  now i have go into file exploreer and and click on that download file
o open mongodb compas  so click on plus(+) in left sidebar a new connectin page open in url give the url for my service you remmeber when you use get post deete then you need to give this url
so same when i want to use database then first know where is my database connect so in url is first part is protocal where we are learning http 
so protocal is http but in case of mongo db protocal is mongodb  and after that ://localhost:  like where at the place of localhost you have to give the ip address
lets you have connect to your computer with your friend computer then give the public ip address of your firend laptop

and every service we have a port number then so here when you comes to mongodb they have a port number called 27017
this is standard port you can configure it in different way and then i have click on save and connect 
when you add then bydefault in this localhost or url there is three database one is admin one is config one is local 

its a cient server architecture so client come in three form one is graphical gui graphical user interface basically graphical client this mono compas is graphical client 
like you need to click on buttons only like in above created new connection like localhost270107  when you go on that connection then in this click on + icon for creating database 

the other one is command line command line interface is theere  this will be done by databse admin databse admin knowning databse query 
you need not to learn any language 

third option is bia source code source code means via library this is specific to programming language if you are using python then install to python specific library 
but right now we are interested in node js so know node js library so you shoud install third party library which are related to node js you need to install client programming
as you install mongo db step step by step so server is also already installed 

you have go to task manager i task manager there is two section one is processes and one is services services are expected to ru 24 7 

so this background service running in the background . we will be connecting our client program , whether it is using mongo compas or using library 
so we got to know that even database is client server architecture 
basically client ins running in the browser when it comes to http and server will be running hardware hosted in a hardware basicaly laptop virtual machine cloud 

now lets go to the graphical user interface in mongodb compas 
here lets say i want to create database like in past i create new connectin that part go and clickn  on + icon i said i want to create school name database and within the school i want student name table or collection 

there will be a database in your database you organize the data how do you organiza your data ?
so database is school and tables are these 
students, teachers, departemtns 
students table column=  name(string), age(integer), subjects(array)
teachers table column= name ,age experience 
departments table column= name 
and each coumn have a data type
every data will have shape and shape is what structure structure is what schema 
structure of data= schema , so what is schema? schema will define what is the table name what are all the columns and in the columns what should be the datatypes of each value 
this information is stored as part of schema , these are all relational database concept like when you write schema for only three column and you will try to add one more column 
then it doen not allow because it is not part of schema schema define the shape of the table 


and tables means collections and ech tables have multiple columns when you think about columns it is properties and rows in the table have mutiple rows 
multiple rows is called as records or documents
so i have create school database in schooldatabase i have create student table or collection 
so school is created and within the school student table is created ,when you come on database on school then when you click on + icon then you can add 
more collections or table liken  also add teachers table and i can add departments also and when you go in each table like if you click any of the collection then a add data button come 
if you click on this then you can add or insert each datta into tables when you click on add data then two option is come import json or csv file or insert document 
and when you click on insert document then it look like json object like within mongodb you can add data like a json 
{
    "name":"vikram",
    'age":"36",
    "subjects":["english","hindi"]

}
so this document called as one row and each row have three column properties  name , age , subjects   and now when you click on insert then it added on mongodb as a one document
when you insert a document then automatically one coolumn additionaly added which is _id   which is created by mongo db which is have unique id 
you can also add array of multiple document like when you click on add data and insert document then like this 
[
   {
    "name":"vikram",
    'age":"36",
    "subjects":["english","hindi"]

}, 
{
    "name":"suraj",
    'age":"26",
    "subjects":["english","math"]

}
]
and when you click on add then all document s added in mongo db and in each added document you can also see one additional column  which i s_id which is added by mongodb automaticaly 

and in mongodb where all document s insert you can go on each document then in each document in right above corener also delete and edit option given you can also edit the each document and deleteeach document whatwever 
you want 
like there is also option of copy when you cllick on any added document copy icon and when you edit name and again save then a seperate documebt  added one more clone document
which allow you to clone the document and you allow to do minar changes so this is the plus point what is the minus point minus point is disadvantage of mongodb compas miar points is 
when you try to edit any document disadvantage of this mongodb compas is if you added like such document  which is not related to schema or which is not follow schema and when you click on add then it all also 
added without any restriction 
because by default it is not any restriction and validation bydefault mongodb not reject any data by default you can insert any json data in any collection 

so we got to  know how to use client program how to use client program is one graphical user interface now i will go to library we willlearn how to interact with databse with library 
so in past i use mongo compass for add databse add collection inser tdata using gui client program so whatever i perform using mongodb compas now i will perform same thing using progrsmming language 
1)- nodejs -> mongo db library , mongoose library 
ongodb ike a native library or official library , which gave only the core and main mongodb operations 
whatever you do from ui you do from mongodb library , there is one more library cllled as mongoose but there is third part library mongoose in mostr online project we use mongoose not mongodb 
beacause mongodb have not validation but when you use mongoose there is validation 
mongodb (no validaion , no type cheking , no schema ) there is alsoone library mongoose which is widely used because of validation and  schema although we are using no sql we need to validation data type checking and scema in mongoose 


mongoose library internally used mongo db 

mongo db is a document oriented , no sql databse management system 
since mongo db is nosql database we do not need to provide the schema and we can insert the data of any shape in a document

why should be use mongo db

1. fast : mpngp db provide high speed reads and write to collection and document 
2. flexible : since mongo db is schea less it provides the flexibility of inserting a record in any shape 
3. no joins : in mongo db , we can nest collection so we dont have to perform complex join quiries to get result 
4. easy to use : mongo db uses query language that is similer to javascript , and it is very easy to understand 
5. scalable : mongo db is very easy scale horizentaly i . e. distributing data across a cluster of large number of server 

what are documents in mongo db?
a document in mongo db is a record in a collection
data is stored inside document in a json format called bson or binary javascript object notation 

what are collections into mongodb ?

in mongo db , data is stored inside a document and these document are grouped inside a collection .
we can thing that document as a record or row and collection as a table in sql 

mongo data types :
mongo db support  all data type which are supported by json with some additional data type 
1. Integer; integer are used to store whole number depending upon our server these can be 32 bits and 64 bits .
2. Double : Doubles are used store floating point number
3. timestamp : timestamp are used to record when a document has been created or modified 
4. binarry data : it stores binary data such as images etc 
0110
1001
1010
5. object id : object id is a spaical data type that store the unique id of document 
6. null ; null is a data type that is used to represent the absence of data 

hands on crud operation 

like open mongo db cell 
and type this command " show collections;" it show all collection which currently present in your mongo db
> show collections 
sample (it means cutrently in my mongo db database one collection present which is sample collection )
like if you want to create new collection then you want to run this command db.createCollection('users')  it means you create a collection named users
>db.createCollection('users')
{"ok":1}, it means this acknowledgement come when you run above command it means collection created successfully 
>show collections 
sample
users 
>db.users.find()
>db.users.insertOne({name:"John",age:21})
we have inserted one document let insert another 
>db.users.insertOne({name:"deepa",age:31})
now run this command 
>db.users.find()
then as a out put both document come with object id which i have created 
>db.users.updateOne({name:"john"},{$set:{name:"Jhon"}})
>db.users.updateMany({age:{$gt:18}},{$set:{age:25}});
>db.users.deleteOne({name:"John"});

like if you wan also delete the collection like users then write this below command 
>db.users.drop();


as express js is not opinionated so we can use mongo db database quitly quikly 
using mongo db with express or any node js application ,we can use ne of the many npm packages two of them are native mongodb driver and mongoose package 

#### native mongo db driver
the native mongo db driver is the npm package that allow us to directly interact with our mongodb server , it is created by the mongo db team 
to allow application to interact with mongo db server very much like using mongo db shell 

why use native mongo db url 
so there are several issue that using the mongo db driver 
1. fast : as it is very thin abstraction it provides really good performance 
2. easy : using mongo db driver is very easy as it make use of same syntex that is used in mongo db shell
3. schema less: we can use query without using predefined schema for our collection and document 

### hands on : mondo db driver hands on 
const MongoClient=require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const assert=require('assert');
const url="mongodb://localhost:27017";
const dbName="MyProject";
const client=new MongoClient(url,{useNewUrlParser:true,useUnifiedTopology:true});
client.connect(function(error){
    assert.equal(err,null);
    console.log("Connected Successfully");
    const db=client.db(dbName);
    const collection=db.collection("users");
    const data=[{name:"john",age:30},
    {name:"janu",age:50},
    {name:"manu",age:80}];
    collection.insertMany(data,function(error,result){
        assert.equal(error,null);
        console.log(result);
        client.close();
    });
})
###  mongoose 
the mongoose package is odm (object data mapper )
it allow us to define schema and models and instead of interacting with the database directly we can just interact with the model instance 

and the mongoose will issues the quiries

#### why use mongoose ?
there are several benifits of using mongoose 
1. speed : with all the additional benifits mongoose still provides the very good data acess speed .
2. schema : we can inforce strict schema validation to keep our data in a normalized state .
3. validation : monggose take validation of rules defined in schema definition
4, utilities : mongoose has several built in method that allow us to run custom code on successfull query execution 
5. reduce effort: mongoose greatly reduce the time it takes for developer to  build an application .
